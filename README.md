**DEPRECATED**: This is HybridApp (Legacy). This is now out of date and is not recommended to use. Use [the new version](https://github.com/OldUser101/HybridApp) instead.

# HybridApp
HybridApp is a set of tools and utilities that allow anyone to create a desktop program from their favourite websites. Written in VB.NET.
# Usage
HybridApp is similar to Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) but it works with any website. It uses Microsoft WebView2 for the browser engine.

Supported Platforms:
- 32-bit and 64-bit Windows

The latest version of HybridApp can be downloaded from the [releases](https://github.com/OldUser101/HybridApp/releases) page.
HybridApp is available in a MSI format.
# Building
HybridApp uses Visual Basic .NET and the .NET Framework. You will need a suitable version of Visual Studio.
It relies on the NuGet WebView2 package, so you will need access to this too.
It also uses the Visual Studio Installer Projects for building the MSI. You can obtain these from the extensions marketplace.
# Notes
The programs are still referred to as 'WebAppPackage' and 'WebAppCreator' in the code. This is due to a last minute name change.
