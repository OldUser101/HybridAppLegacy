# HybridApp
HybridApp is a set of tools and utilities that allow anyone to create a desktop program from their favourite websites. Written in VB.NET.
# Usage
HybridApp is similar to Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) but it works with any website. It uses Microsoft WebView2 for the browser engine.

Supported Platforms:
- 32-bit and 64-bit Windows

The latest version of HybridApp can be downloaded from the [releases](https://github.com/OldUser101/HybridApp/releases) page.
HybridApp is available in a MSI format.
# Notes
The programs are still referred to as 'WebAppPackage' and 'WebAppCreator' in the code. This is due to a last minute name change.
