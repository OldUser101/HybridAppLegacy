# HybridApp
HybridApp is a set of tools and utilities that allow anyone to create a desktop program from their favourite websites. Written in VB.NET.
# Usage
HybridApp is similar to Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) but it works with any website. It uses Microsoft WebView2 for the browser engine.
# Notes
The programs are still referred to as 'WebAppPackage' and 'WebAppCreator' in the code. This is due to a last minute name change.
